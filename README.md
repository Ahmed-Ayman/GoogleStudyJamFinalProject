# this is a project for the GOOGLE study jam program.

this was my first experience with Android, we were attending it in Mushtarak co-working space
in a collaboration with GDG cairo.

this final project also was the same one I have applied for Nasa space apps
competition in Zewail City 2016 but wit less features.

it's just an app that gives you information about the moon as well as daily
nice pictures.

here are some photos from the app.
